(calls) 1. (2 points)
read (3, "se, and the Pearl,\n  I see where"..., 8192) = 8192
fd is 3, indicating that the data is being read from the file descriptor 3.
buffer is a pointer to the string "se, and the Pearl,\n  I see where".
count is 8192, indicating that the program intends to read up 
to 8192 bytes from the file descriptor.

(calls) 2. (2 points)
 write(1, "tests/leaves-of-grass.txt: 43: 6"..., 143) = 143  
 1 File descriptor, 
 indicating that the data is being written to the standard output (stdout).     
"tests/leaves-of-grass.txt: 43: 6".  The buffer containing the data to be written.
143  The number of bytes to write, specifying the length of the data.

without -f flag
    Only traces the main process.
    Does not show system calls made by child processes.
    Might miss important system call information if the 
    main process forks and the child processes perform significant work.

malloc function in C is used to 
dynamically allocate memory during program execution

2 times
fgets function in C is used to read a line from a 
file stream (or from stdin if the stream is stdin) 
and store it in a character array. It reads up to a 
specified number of characters or until a newline character is encountered.

(calls) 6. (2 points)

(calls) 7.:

  (i) execve
  s used to execute a program. It replaces the current process 
  image with a new one specified by the provided executable file.

 (ii) brk
 sets the end of the data (heap) segment of 
 the calling process to the specified value

(iii) openat
 is used to open or create a file or directory 
 relative to a specified directory file descriptor

 (iv) mmap
is used to map files or devices into memory. It creates a mapping 
between a process's virtual address space and a file or device

  (v) prlimit64
s used to get or set resource limits for a process. It can control various
 resources such as CPU time, memory usage, and file size.

 (vi) clone
 is used to create a new process, similar to fork. However, 
 clone provides more options for specifying which parts of 
 the process should be shared between the parent and child.

(vii) exit_group
 is used to terminate all threads in a process and the process itself.
  The parameter represents the exit status of the entire process.
